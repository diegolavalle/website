# About Me

I'm a software developer focused on Swift and Apple Platforms. My experience includes building and maintaining apps for iPhone (iOS), iPad and the Mac. I do this every day as part of a dedicated team at Ryanair Labs as well as independently. I also like contributing code to Open Source as a way to give back to the community.
